            <p>Things are random in life. For example, my names. I received my Chinese name Shangyi Zhong wihout my own thoughts, well of course, because I wasn't even born. I'm not sure if my parents really thought about it carefully. I received my English name Benny wihout my own thoughts either. I'm very sure my teacher who gave it to me didn't think about it because she gave it two me after only around 5 seconds of hesitation after knowing I didn't have an English name. Are things out of my own will, or are things determined by fate? What shapes who I am? Can the information I am about to provide characterize who I am or who I wanted to be? I wonder. </p>
            <p>In terms of academics, I enjoy sociology, computer science, and physics. I like sociology for its subtle conflict with the reality; I like physics for its harmony with the reality; and I like computer science for its isolation with the reality. </p>
            <p>In terms of hobbies, I enjoy playing tennis and guitar. Cool fact, they are identical in size!</p>
            <p>I wanted to become an indie developer to bring laughter - the one symbol for hapiness - to people of all kinds. BTW, my favorite game is <i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i>. Certainly, this is not a game that can be made independently. If you ask what my favorite indie game is, well, it's <i>Undertale. </i></p>
