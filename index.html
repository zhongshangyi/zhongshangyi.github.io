            <h1>Hi!</h1>
            <p>Things are random in life. For example, my names. I received my Chinese name Shangyi Zhong without my own input, of course, because I wasn't even born. I'm not sure if my parents really thought about it carefully. I received my English name Benny without my own input either. I'm very sure the teacher who gave it to me didn't think about it because she gave it to me after only roughly five seconds of hesitation after learning that I didn't have an English name. Are things out of my own will or are things determined by fate? What shapes who I am? Can the information I am about to provide characterize who I am or who I want to be? I wonder.</p>
            <p>In terms of academics, I enjoy sociology, computer science, and physics. I like sociology for its subtle conflict with reality; I like physics for its harmony with reality; and I like computer science for its isolation from reality. I'm currently focusing on sociology, more specifically, digital divide and industrial transformation under globalization.
            <p>In terms of hobbies, I enjoy playing tennis and guitar. Cool fact, the racket and the guitar are identical in size!</p> 
            <p>I wanted to become an indie developer to bring laughter - the universal symbol of happiness - to people of all kinds. Oh and by the way, my favorite game is <i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i>. Certainly, this is not a game that can be made independently. If you ask what my favorite indie game is, well, it's <i>Undertale</i>.</p>
